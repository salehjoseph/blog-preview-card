## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my project! This blog preview card is a front-end coding challenge I completed to enhance my skills in HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

In this project, I built a blog preview card that closely matches the provided design. Here are the key features:

- Interactive hover and focus states for all elements.

## Design Inspiration

The design was inspired by a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). It allowed me to practice creating responsive layouts and applying CSS styling effectively.

## Getting Started

To build this project, I followed these steps:

1. **Setup**: Created a public repository on GitHub to share my code.
2. **Planning**: Reviewed the design and planned my approach for reusable CSS classes.
3. **HTML Structure**: Focused on structuring the content before applying styles.
4. **Styling**: Developed base styles, including typography and layout adjustments, before refining each section.

## Project Files

- **Designs**: The design files can be found in the `/design` folder (both mobile and desktop versions).
- **Assets**: All required assets, including images, are located in the `/assets` folder.
- **Fonts**: I chose to link to Google Fonts for typography.

## Deployment

This project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://yourusername.github.io/blog-preview-card/). You can view the live version [here](https://yourusername.github.io/blog-preview-card/).

## Lessons Learned

Through this challenge, I gained valuable experience in:

- Building responsive web components.
- Enhancing my CSS skills for styling and layout.
- Understanding the importance of user interactions and feedback.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to:

- Add more interactive features.
- Optimize for accessibility.
